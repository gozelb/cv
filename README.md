## About

I am a medical researcher with a strong background in microbiology and neurosciences,
currently transitioning into software development with a strong focus on Python.

After years of designing complex experimental protocols and analyzing biomedical data,
I now build applications that automate workflows, reduce human error,
and make medical data easier to use and interpret.

My goal is simple:  
**turn medical complexity into reliable, usable software.**

## What I’m building now

- 🧠 Python-based applications for neuropsychological assessments  
- 📄 Automated analysis of scanned medical questionnaires (PDF → data → report)  
- ⚙️ Backend APIs using FastAPI and asynchronous task processing  
- 📊 Data pipelines for medical and experimental datasets  
- 🧪 Prototypes combining rule-based logic with AI-assisted interpretation
